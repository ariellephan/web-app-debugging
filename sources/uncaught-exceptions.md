Uncaught Exceptions
===================

Sometimes you may have a console error but have no idea where or how the exception was thrown. You can have the dev tools immediate break at uncaught or caught exceptions by clicking the <img src="../sources/break.png" style="display: inline;"/> icon. Use in conjunction with pretty-print in minfied apps.

Reload the page. A error should be in the console. Use the uncaught exceptions to break at the error location and determine how to fix the problem.
