Network
=======

The network tab is very useful for inspecting network requests. Note: the developer tools need to be open for requests to be logged.

  * The red button at the top left enables and disables the logging of requests (defaults on).
  * The filter icon allows you to filter request by type and by key words.
  * Mouse over individual requests on the timeline column to view timing information.
  * The initiator column has a link to the file and line number from where the request was initiated.
